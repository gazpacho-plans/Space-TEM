# **Game Design Document: Space TEM 3**

## **1\. Game Concept**

**Space TEM 3** is a collaborative, competitive multiplayer game played primarily on Discord, inspired by *Terra Invicta* and traditional "The Extremist Map" (TEM) games.  
Players take on the roles of elite **Councillors** within one of four ideological factions (**Quads**). These factions are locked in a clandestine struggle for control of Earth's nations in the face of a mysterious off-world event. The game is a unique blend of grand strategy, political intrigue, and character-driven roleplay.  
The game unfolds in a single, continuous phase. Strategic actions like seizing **Control Points** in nations, undertaking missions, and taking over powerful global **Organizations (Orgs)** occur concurrently with ongoing political drama. Players must manage their **Resources** to fund their operations, creating a dynamic and constantly evolving narrative.  
The game will be managed and facilitated by a custom Discord bot that handles all game functions.

## **2\. Factions (Quads)**

The game features four primary factions, each with a unique ideology and long-term goal concerning the "alien" situation, mapped to the political compass.

* **The Academy (Authoritarian Left):** A unified, scientifically-optimized world government is the only answer.  
* **Humanity First (Authoritarian Right):** The alien threat must be met with overwhelming force under a militaristic, authoritarian hand.  
* **The Protectorate (Libertarian Left):** Humanity must be defended, but not at the cost of its soul. Uphold civil liberties and seek cooperation.  
* **The Initiative (Libertarian Right):** The crisis is the ultimate business opportunity. Profit from the chaos and let corporations, not nations, rule.

## **3\. Player Characters (Councillors)**

### **3.1. Character Creation Process**

A player's journey begins by choosing a **Profession** for their Councillor. This choice is critical, as it defines:

1. **Starting Attribute Ranges:** The bot will randomly roll the Councillor's initial attributes within a range set by the Profession.  
2. **Mission Access:** Each Profession grants access to a unique set of missions, making teamwork and diverse skills essential for a Quad's success.

### **3.2. Core Attributes**

* **üì¢ Persuasion:** Influencing people and public opinion.  
* **üîé Investigation:** Uncovering information and finding targets.  
* **üï∂Ô∏è Espionage:** Subterfuge, theft, and covert operations.  
* **üéñÔ∏è Command:** Leading military forces and managing assets in hostile territory.  
* **üîê Security:** Defense, counter-espionage, and protecting assets.  
* **‚öõÔ∏è Science:** Research and technological understanding.  
* **üè¢ Administration:** Management and logistics. Determines the number of Orgs a Councillor can control.

### **3.3. Professions**

At the start of the game, players can choose from a variety of **Core Professions**. As they gain experience, more **Specialized Professions** may become available.  
**Core Professions (Examples):**

* **ü§ù Diplomat:** An influential communicator who excels at peaceful and profitable relations.  
* **üëÅ Spy:** A trained gatherer of information by covert means.  
* **üëî Executive:** A leader in government or business, adept at getting things done.  
* **üó£ Activist:** Seeks social change through persuasion rather than violence.  
* **üíª Hacker:** An expert in extracting information from computer networks.  
* **üí• Operative:** A trained expert in both espionage and small-scale violent action.

### **3.4. Traits & Progression**

Councillors have passive **Traits** that provide unique bonuses or penalties. Each Councillor starts with one free, randomly assigned positive Trait, and may also begin with a negative or mixed trait that adds complexity to their character. As they gain **XP** from missions, they can improve their attributes and spend XP to acquire new, powerful Traits or pay a cost to remove negative ones.  
**Example Traits:** Government, Streetwise, Quick Learner, Paranoid, Inflexible.

## **4\. Nations, Control Points, and Influence**

The game map is a representation of Earth in 2022, divided into nations and regions.

* **Control Points (CPs):** Each nation has a number of CPs, representing control over its government, military, and key institutions.  
* **Taking Control:** A faction seizes a CP by successfully executing a **Control Nation** mission. When a faction holds the majority of CPs in a nation, it controls that nation.  
* **Public Opinion:** The success chance of a Control Nation mission is heavily influenced by your faction's **Public Opinion** in that nation. Public Opinion is raised by running successful **Public Campaign** missions.  
* **Benefits of Control:** Controlling a nation provides the faction with a significant income of Resources. Specific nations with space launch facilities will also provide a large amount of **üöÄ Boost**.

## **5\. Resources**

### **5.1. Terrestrial Resources**

* **üí∞ Money:** Funds most activities.  
* **‚ú® Influence:** Used for diplomatic and political actions.  
* **‚öîÔ∏è Operations:** Capacity for direct, high-risk missions.  
* **üî¨ Research:** Fuels technological advancement.  
* **üöÄ Boost:** Represents the faction's capacity to launch mass into Earth's orbit.

### **5.2. Space Resources**

*These resources are primarily obtained from mining modules on space habitats and are crucial for building and maintaining an off-world presence.*

* **üíß Water:** Vital for life support and producing advanced propellants.  
* **üî• Volatiles:** Highly reactive substances used for life support and space habitats, like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and chlorine.  
* **‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals:** Common materials used for standard construction of habs and ships.  
* **ü™ô Noble Metals:** Used in advanced construction and can be sold on Earth for üí∞ Money.  
* **‚ò¢Ô∏è Fissiles:** Required for advanced nuclear propulsion and weapons.

## **6\. Gameplay Loop & Councillor Missions**

The game proceeds in weekly turns, each divided into two distinct phases to allow for espionage, planning, and reaction.

* **Phase 1: Commitment & Intel:** At the start of the week, players commit their Councillors to major, turn-long missions (e.g., Control Nation, Hostile Takeover, Launch Hab) or send them on quick intelligence-gathering missions (Investigate).  
* **Phase 2: Action & Reaction:** After reviewing the intel, players have a chance to react. Councillors who are free can be assigned to quick defensive missions (Protect Target). At the end of this phase, all committed and reactive missions are resolved.

## **7\. Organizations (Orgs)**

Orgs are powerful non-player entities that can be acquired and controlled by individual Councillors. They provide passive resource bonuses and can even unlock mission access for Councillors who wouldn't normally have it. Orgs can be acquired in two ways: through a clandestine **Hostile Takeover** mission, or by establishing a political foothold in an Org's home nation and using a **Purchase Org** mission. Orgs can be transferred between Councillors within the same faction for a small administrative cost. The number of Orgs a Councillor can control is limited by their **üè¢ Administration** attribute.

## **8\. The Space Game: Habitats (Habs)**

Beyond the shadow war on Earth lies the next frontier: space. Factions can design, build, and launch off-world habitats (Habs) to establish humanity's first permanent foothold in the solar system.

* **Purpose:** Habs are primarily scientific and industrial facilities. Councillors can travel to these Habs to manage research far more effectively than on Earth. Habs are also the only source of rare space resources and the only locations where advanced spaceships can be built.  
* **Construction:** The ability to build Habs and their advanced modules is unlocked through the Global and Faction Research projects. Once a design is unlocked, a Councillor must be assigned to a Launch Hab mission to expend the vast amount of **üöÄ Boost** required to put the core station into orbit.  
* **Customization:** Habs are not monolithic. They are customized by adding specific modules, such as Laboratories, Supply Docks, Mines, and Shipyards, allowing each faction to specialize their off-world bases to suit their strategic goals.

### **9.2. Mission Resolution Logic**

#### **9.2.0. Turn Structure & Resolution Order**

The weekly turn is resolved in a strict sequence to allow for intelligence and reaction gameplay.

1. **Phase 1: Commitment & Intel**  
   * Players assign Councillors to either **Committed Missions** (e.g., Control Nation, Hostile Takeover, Go to Hiding, Turn Councillor) or **Quick Intel Missions** (Investigate Councillor).  
   * At the end of Phase 1, all Investigate missions are resolved simultaneously. Intel reports are sent privately to the relevant players.  
2. **Mid-Turn: Reaction Window**  
   * Players review the intel reports.  
   * Players may choose to **Cancel** any of their previously assigned Committed Missions.  
   * **Penalty:** If a mission is cancelled, the resources spent on it are **lost**. The Councillor becomes free for Phase 2\.  
3. **Phase 2: Action & Reaction**  
   * Any Councillor not on a Committed Mission can be assigned to a **Quick Reaction Mission** (e.g., Protect Target).  
   * At the end of Phase 2, all remaining Committed Missions and all Quick Reaction Missions are resolved simultaneously.  
   * The turn report is generated and published.  
* **General Formula:** (Relevant\_Attribute \+ d10\_Roll \+ Modifiers)  
* **Success Tiers:** Missions have four potential outcomes based on how much the roll beats or misses the DC.  
  * **Critical Success:** Occurs when the roll exceeds the DC by 10 or more. Grants a significant bonus.  
  * **Success:** Occurs when the roll meets or exceeds the DC.

### **9.3. Character Creation Logic**

* **Process:**  
  1. Player runs /create\_councillor command, choosing a Profession.  
  2. Bot retrieves the attribute ranges for that Profession from the table in 9.3.1.  
  3. For each attribute, the bot rolls a random number within the defined range.  
  4. The bot assigns one random positive Trait **with a 0 XP Cost** from the table in 9.4.1.  
  5. The bot has a small chance to also assign a random Negative or Mixed Trait to the character from the tables in 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.  
  6. The resulting Councillor object is saved to the database.  
* **9.3.1. Profession Attribute Ranges Table:**

### **9.7. Research System**

The Research System allows factions to unlock permanent bonuses and new gameplay mechanics by spending üî¨ Research points on Projects.

* **Passive Research Generation:** At the end of each turn, every faction generates a base amount of üî¨ Research equal to the sum of the **‚öõÔ∏è Science** attribute of all their active Councillors. This research is added to a general pool.  
* **Project Types:**  
  * **Global Projects:** Large-scale, game-changing technologies available to all factions. Factions contribute from their research pool. The faction that contributes the most when the project is completed receives a special bonus.  
  * **Faction Projects:** Smaller, repeatable projects unique to each faction that provide passive bonuses.  
* **Starter Global Projects Table:**

| Global Project | Research Cost | Effect on Completion | Top Contributor Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Alien Materials Analysis** | 500 | Unlocks the ability to build advanced orbitals. | Receive a free lump sum of üöÄ Boost. |
| **Global Communications Network** | 300 | All Public Campaign missions cost 5 less ‚ú® Influence. | Your faction's Public Campaign missions are 10% more effective. |

* **Starter Faction Projects Table:**

| Faction | Project Name | Research Cost | Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Academy** | Unified Education Initiative | 150 | \+1 to all Public Campaign rolls in nations with high education. |
| **Humanity First** | Advanced Weapons | 200 | \+1 to all Control Nation rolls. |
| **The Protectorate** | Global Humanitarian Aid | 150 | Passively gain a small amount of Public Opinion in all controlled nations each turn. |
| **The Initiative** | Insider Trading Network | 200 | \+10% üí∞ Money income from all controlled Orgs. |

### **9.8. Space Habitats (Habs) System**

This section details the mechanics for building and managing off-world habitats.

* **Upkeep:** At the end of each turn, every Hab module incurs an upkeep cost in Space Resources. If the faction's stockpile is insufficient to pay, the difference is automatically paid in **üöÄ Boost** at an inefficient ratio (e.g., 1 Boost per 5 resource points). Failure to pay upkeep may result in modules becoming inactive.  
* **Hab Modules Table:**

| Tier | Module Name | Location | Effect | Upkeep Cost |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Laboratory Module | Orbital | \+5 passive üî¨ Research per turn. | 1 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals |
| 1 | Communications Module | Orbital | \+1 to all Investigate mission rolls faction-wide. | 1 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals |
| 1 | Supply Module | Orbital | Reduces total upkeep cost of all other modules on the Hab by 10%. | 1 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals |
| 2 | Space Construction Dock | Orbital | Enables construction of Tier 1 Habs and simple spaceships. | 5 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals, 2 ü™ô Noble Metals |
| 2 | Mining Complex | Surface | Generates a base income of local Space Resources. | 3 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals, 1 üî• Volatiles |
| 3 | Hydroponics Module | Any | Reduces üíß Water and üî• Volatiles upkeep costs for the Hab to zero. | 5 ‚öôÔ∏è Base Metals, 2 ü™ô Noble Metals |
| 3 | Defence Battlestation | Any | Enables Assault Space Asset mission and adds \+5 to defense rolls against it. | 5 ü™ô Noble Metals, 2 ‚ò¢Ô∏è Fissiles |

### **9.9. Spacecraft & Movement**

Spacecraft movement is handled through planned **Transfers**. A ship's performance is determined by its **Size Class** and the **Propulsion Technology** its faction has researched. The cost of transfers is measured in **Delta-V (Œîv)**, and the time they take is determined by the ship's effective **Thrust**. The Œîv cost for a given transfer changes monthly based on planetary alignment, creating strategic **transfer windows**.  
There are three primary transfer types:

1. **High-Thrust Transfer:** The fastest method, representing a "straight line" burn. It has an extremely high Œîv cost.  
2. **Hohmann Transfer:** The standard, fuel-efficient maneuver. It has a much lower Œîv cost but requires waiting for a favorable "transfer window".  
3. **Gravity Assist Transfer:** The most fuel-efficient method for long-range travel. It involves chaining two or more Hohmann transfers together, using a planetary flyby to gain a "slingshot" effect.

###  **9.10. The Transfer Planner**

The Transfer Planner is an interactive bot command (/plan\_transfer) that allows players to calculate and commit to spacecraft maneuvers.

####  **9.10.1. Player Interface**

The planner will present players with a clear interface to select a departure point, destination, optional flyby body, and the ship they wish to use. The tool will display a forecast for the selected departure month, showing the calculated Œîv cost and travel time for each available transfer type based on the ship's class and the faction's current tech level.

#### **9.10.2. Backend Logic & Calculation**

When a player interacts with the planner, the bot runs the following sequential logic:  
**1\. Gather Inputs:**

* start\_location, destination, flyby\_location (optional), ship\_id, departure\_month.

**2\. Determine Effective Ship Performance:**

* Get the ship's ship\_class and its owner faction from the ship\_id.  
* Look up the faction's current Propulsion Technology level.  
* Get the Base Œîv and Base Thrust from the **Ship Class Table (9.11)**.  
* Get the Œîv Multiplier and Thrust Multiplier from the **Propulsion Technology Table (9.11)**.  
* Calculate the ship's performance for this maneuver:  
  * Effective Œîv Budget \= Base Œîv \* Œîv Multiplier  
  * Effective Thrust \= Base Thrust \* Thrust Multiplier

**3\. Calculate All Potential Transfers:**

* **For a Hohmann Transfer:**  
  * **Cost:** Final Œîv Cost \= (Base Hohmann Cost for Route) \* (Phase Angle Penalty Multiplier for departure\_month)  
  * **Time:** Final Travel Time \= (Base Travel Time for Route) / Effective Thrust  
* **For a High-Thrust Transfer:**  
  * **Cost:** Calculate based on straight-line distance, applying a high, fixed Œîv cost per AU.  
  * **Time:** Travel Time \= (Distance in AU) \* 2 Months (Note: Not affected by thrust, as it represents a brute-force constant burn).  
* **For a Gravity Assist Transfer (if flyby\_location is provided):**  
  * Calculate the cost and time for Leg 1 (start ‚Üí flyby).  
  * Calculate the cost and time for Leg 2 (flyby ‚Üí destination), applying the Gravity Assist Bonus (e.g., \-40% Œîv cost) to this leg.  
  * The final result is the sum of both legs' costs and times.

**4\. Display Results:**

* The bot populates the UI with the calculated costs and times for each available transfer type.  
* It compares the Final Œîv Cost for each option against the ship's Effective Œîv Budget to show an "Affordable?" status.

**5\. Handle Commitment:**

* When a player commits to a plan, the bot validates that the Effective Œîv Budget is sufficient for the maneuver.  
* If valid, it assigns the Councillor to the **Execute Transfer** mission.

###  **9.11. Ship Classes & Technology**

Spaceships are built at **Space Construction Docks** or more advanced Shipyards. Their capabilities are defined by their size class, which is then modified by the owner faction's researched propulsion technology.  
**Ship Class Base Stats Table:**

| Class | Base Œîv Budget | Base Thrust | Construction Cost (‚öôÔ∏è/ü™ô/‚ò¢Ô∏è) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Small | 6.0 km/s | 1 | 20 / 5 / 0 |
| Medium | 10.0 km/s | 2 | 50 / 15 / 5 |
| Large | 15.0 km/s | 3 | 120 / 40 / 15 |

**Propulsion Technology Table:**

| Technology Name | Research Prerequisite | Œîv Multiplier | Thrust Multiplier |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Basic Chemical | *(Starting Tech)* | x1.0 | x1.0 |
| Advanced Chemical | "Advanced Propellants" | x1.2 | x1.25 |
| Fission Torch | "Fission Propulsion" | x2.0 | x1.5 |
