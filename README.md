# Space-TEM

## **1\. Game Concept**

**Space TEM 3** is a collaborative, competitive multiplayer game played primarily on Discord, inspired by *Terra Invicta* and traditional "The Extremist Map" (TEM) games.  
Players take on the roles of elite **Councillors** within one of four ideological factions **Quads**. These factions are locked in a clandestine struggle for control of Earth's nations in the face of a mysterious off-world event. The game is a unique blend of grand strategy, political intrigue, and character-driven roleplay.  
The game unfolds in a single, continuous phase. Strategic actions like seizing **Control Points** in nations, undertaking missions, and taking over powerful global **Organizations (Orgs)** occur concurrently with ongoing political drama. Players must manage their **Resources** to fund their operations, creating a dynamic and constantly evolving narrative.  
The game will be managed and facilitated by a custom Discord bot that handles all game functions.

## **2\. Factions (Quads)**

The game features four primary factions, each with a unique ideology and long-term goal concerning the "alien" situation, mapped to the political compass.

* **The Academy (Authoritarian Left):** A unified, scientifically-optimized world government is the only answer.  
* **Humanity First (Authoritarian Right):** The alien threat must be met with overwhelming force under a militaristic, authoritarian hand.  
* **The Protectorate (Libertarian Left):** Humanity must be defended, but not at the cost of its soul. Uphold civil liberties and seek cooperation.  
* **The Initiative (Libertarian Right):** The crisis is the ultimate business opportunity. Profit from the chaos and let corporations, not nations, rule.

## **3\. Player Characters (Councillors)**

### **3.1. Character Creation Process**

A player's journey begins by choosing a **Profession** for their Councillor. This choice is critical, as it defines:

1. **Starting Attribute Ranges:** The bot will randomly roll the Councillor's initial attributes within a range set by the Profession.  
2. **Mission Access:** Each Profession grants access to a unique set of missions, making teamwork and diverse skills essential for a Quad's success.

### **3.2. Core Attributes**

* **📢 Persuasion:** Influencing people and public opinion.  
* **🔎 Investigation:** Uncovering information and finding targets.  
* **🕶️ Espionage:** Subterfuge, theft, and covert operations.  
* **🎖️ Command:** Leading military forces and managing assets in hostile territory.  
* **🔐 Security:** Defense, counter-espionage, and protecting assets.  
* **⚛️ Science:** Research and technological understanding.  
* **🏢 Administration:** Management and logistics. Determines the number of Orgs a Councillor can control.

### **3.3. Professions**

At the start of the game, players can choose from a variety of **Core Professions**. As they gain experience, more **Specialized Professions** may become available.  
**Core Professions (Examples):**

* **🤝 Diplomat:** An influential communicator who excels at peaceful and profitable relations.  
* **👁 Spy:** A trained gatherer of information by covert means.  
* **👔 Executive:** A leader in government or business, adept at getting things done.  
* **🗣 Activist:** Seeks social change through persuasion rather than violence.  
* **💻 Hacker:** An expert in extracting information from computer networks.  
* **💥 Operative:** A trained expert in both espionage and small-scale violent action.

### **3.4. Traits & Progression**

Councillors have passive **Traits** that provide unique bonuses or penalties. Each Councillor starts with one free, randomly assigned positive Trait, and may also begin with a negative or mixed trait that adds complexity to their character. As they gain **XP** from missions, they can improve their attributes and spend XP to acquire new, powerful Traits or pay a cost to remove negative ones.  
**Example Traits:** Government, Streetwise, Quick Learner, Paranoid, Inflexible.

## **4\. Nations, Control Points, and Influence**

The game map is a representation of Earth in 2022, divided into nations and regions.

* **Control Points (CPs):** Each nation has a number of CPs, representing control over its government, military, and key institutions.  
* **Taking Control:** A faction seizes a CP by successfully executing a **Control Nation** mission. When a faction holds the majority of CPs in a nation, it controls that nation.  
* **Public Opinion:** The success chance of a Control Nation mission is heavily influenced by your faction's **Public Opinion** in that nation. Public Opinion is raised by running successful **Public Campaign** missions.  
* **Benefits of Control:** Controlling a nation provides the faction with a significant income of Resources. Specific nations with space launch facilities will also provide a large amount of **🚀 Boost**.

## **5\. Resources**

### **5.1. Terrestrial Resources**

* **💰 Money:** Funds most activities.  
* **✨ Influence:** Used for diplomatic and political actions.  
* **⚔️ Operations:** Capacity for direct, high-risk missions.  
* **🔬 Research:** Fuels technological advancement.  
* **🚀 Boost:** Represents the faction's capacity to launch mass into Earth's orbit.

### **5.2. Space Resources**

*These resources are primarily obtained from mining modules on space habitats and are crucial for building and maintaining an off-world presence.*

* **💧 Water:** Vital for life support and producing advanced propellants.  
* **🔥 Volatiles:** Highly reactive substances used for life support and space habitats, like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and chlorine.  
* **⚙️ Base Metals:** Common materials used for standard construction of habs and ships.  
* **🪙 Noble Metals:** Used in advanced construction and can be sold on Earth for 💰 Money.  
* **☢️ Fissiles:** Required for advanced nuclear propulsion and weapons.

## **6\. Gameplay Loop & Councillor Missions**

The game proceeds in weekly turns, each divided into two distinct phases to allow for espionage, planning, and reaction.

* **Phase 1: Commitment & Intel:** At the start of the week, players commit their Councillors to major, turn-long missions (e.g., Control Nation, Hostile Takeover, Launch Hab) or send them on quick intelligence-gathering missions (Investigate).  
* **Phase 2: Action & Reaction:** After reviewing the intel, players have a chance to react. Councillors who are free can be assigned to quick defensive missions (Protect Target). At the end of this phase, all committed and reactive missions are resolved.

## **7\. Organizations (Orgs)**

Orgs are powerful non-player entities that can be acquired and controlled by individual Councillors. They provide passive resource bonuses and can even unlock mission access for Councillors who wouldn't normally have it. Orgs can be acquired in two ways: through a clandestine **Hostile Takeover** mission, or by establishing a political foothold in an Org's home nation and using a **Purchase Org** mission. Orgs can be transferred between Councillors within the same faction for a small administrative cost. The number of Orgs a Councillor can control is limited by their **🏢 Administration** attribute.

## **8\. The Space Game: Habitats (Habs)**

Beyond the shadow war on Earth lies the next frontier: space. Factions can design, build, and launch off-world habitats (Habs) to establish humanity's first permanent foothold in the solar system.

* **Purpose:** Habs are primarily scientific and industrial facilities. Councillors can travel to these Habs to manage research far more effectively than on Earth. Habs are also the only source of rare space resources and the only locations where advanced spaceships can be built.  
* **Construction:** The ability to build Habs and their advanced modules is unlocked through the Global and Faction Research projects. Once a design is unlocked, a Councillor must be assigned to a Launch Hab mission to expend the vast amount of **🚀 Boost** required to put the core station into orbit.  
* **Customization:** Habs are not monolithic. They are customized by adding specific modules, such as Laboratories, Supply Docks, Mines, and Shipyards, allowing each faction to specialize their off-world bases to suit their strategic goals.
