# Space-TEM

## **1\. Game Concept**

**Space TEM 3** is a collaborative, competitive multiplayer game played primarily on Discord, inspired by *Terra Invicta* and traditional *"The Extremist Map"* (TEM) games.  
Players take on the roles of elite **Councillors** within one of four ideological factions **Quads**. These factions are locked in a clandestine struggle for control of Earth's nations in the face of a mysterious off-world event. The game is a unique blend of grand strategy, political intrigue, and character-driven roleplay.  
The game unfolds in a single, continuous phase. Strategic actions like seizing **Control Points** in nations, undertaking missions, and taking over powerful global **Organizations (Orgs)** occur concurrently with ongoing political drama. Players must manage their **Resources** to fund their operations, creating a dynamic and constantly evolving narrative.  
The game will be managed and facilitated by a custom Discord bot that handles all game functions.
